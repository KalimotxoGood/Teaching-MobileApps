# Post Mortem

This has been an experience that I've been looking for and am looking forward to continue throughout the semester, time permitted. So far learning to code and do something totally new and "my own" has been an experiene similar to my Summer REU where I was assigned to do research. Unfortunately, the research I was doing didn't have me working in development which was what i was looking for to prepare me for industry. So far in this project I have been able to practice and brush up on my coding skills.

Although I didn't have time to make the best ways of scrambling the expressions, such as methods that could reverse eachother. However, I am still proud of myself that I was able to learn what I needed to do to ultimatelyy accomplish that. I learned how to manipulate strings using MoveNext by instantiating enumerators on them. I never thought I'd need to do that. Sure, I could have done the same thing with a list but for my purposes, the enumeration method is more efficient because it only creates a small variable rather than replicating the whole list. There's also less coupling so it was easier to code. Maybe I should done it both ways for fun. I wish I had more time in life.

It was very frustrating to learn to code sophisticatedly. By this I mean being able to do things that you've never done before and become more advanced or "sophisticated" in your coding skills. It was frustrating but fun; even though I was having a good time, time was fling by too quickly while I coded and sometimes I wonder if I wasted my time approaching the solution incorrectly. That's okay, because I persevered and I'm satisfied with my app. I'd like to do a hackathon because I could really benefit from it. There isn't anthing I couldn't solve so I will set my goals higher next time.

To the future student taking this class, literally do as Professor Adam says and treat it as our favorite class. I'm taking the best classes ever this semester (Clowning, Philosophy of Death, Stats, NA Studies, Security) but this is something I look forward to doing because I am learning very practical things. This will be the class that gets me a job so I'm working on these mobile apps as if they were my child hence I'm working on hard in this class for my future self and that brings me joy. You will need to make sacrifices-- don't waste your time.

The most fun aspect of this assignment was turning in my assignment and knowing that I built something good and original. Nobody really understood why my app was relevant, practical or valuable but it is because being able to see my way of scrambling an expression calculated many times over is a very surreal experience. I literally thought of an original algorithm and I'm watching it get computed on small little phone that is more powerful than any super computer only a few decades ago.

To improve this assignment in the future, I'd provide more possible beginning projects to do that people could fork from. Forking a calculator sounds boring.


*****************************
Use this page to discuss what you learned from completing this assignment.  It should be completed **after** you finish coding your assignment. Your post mortem must be at least 500 words long.  Note that the focus of the paper should be on your reflection, not on structure (e.g. introductory paragraph, conclusion, etc.).  The essay is graded on content (i.e. it shows deep though) rather than syntax (e.g. spelling) and structure.
