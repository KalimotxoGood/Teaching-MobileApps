# APPLICATION NAME
This is an image manipulator that allows the user to access the camera and then choose among multiple features to "change" the photo. among the choices are: remove red, blue or green. Additionally, the user may also negate the colors red blue or green. One change may be done at a time. To save, the user may be reminded that they can use a screen shot to save an image via the save image button.
## System Design 


This app works on Android 5-7.1. The layout was tested on a very small phone (Unihertz jell pro) and the resolution and layout integrity was fine despite it's small size. All features should thus be available to all mobile users!


## Usage

Upon loading the app, you may first choose to "Open Camera".
Once the camera is opened, take a picture and the app will give you the option whether to check the box or retake the picture. 
Once the image is taken, you have options via buttons to choose which effects you would like to see happen to the photo. Please wait a moment or two for the image manipulation to process.
