# FastBreak -- A Fasting App


This is an Android app that implements the Android OS's use of background services to keep you on track while fasting. It keeps track of water needed to drink, time remaining for the fast, and a neat feature that changes the color of a heart emoji as you progress towards your goal. Feel free to check the app anytime to see how you're doing just as you would with social media apps!

Please enjoy this application! It is practical but can be also be a quirky way to get into fasting regimes for your health. Fasting has been shown to lower bloog sugar levels, diabetes, lower atrophy if done correctly and much more! Much much more. So far the app only works for 24 hour fasts due because of some casting issues making the user input unable to be inputted into the CountDownTimer machine by the Android OS library. Also perhaps due to some similar casting issues, the heart is unable to be changed. However, all the other feautures work wonderfully and I hope you put them to use! The water gauge feature is my favorite.

## Usage

This application keeps track of your fasting progress. Starting at the home page, find the "Begin New" button at the upper right hand corner. This is where you start to begin the service

Once you've entered, feel free to go straight to the BEGIN button. Customizable feautures will be available once I find the bug.

After you BEGIN your fast, you will be taken straight to the MOTIVATE page. Here you will shortly notice the Time Remaining. 
You're only going up from here in progress. Press the GET HEART button to view the color changing heart.

The Time changes every 3 seconds and gives you a decimal notation of the time remaining. Have fun!

Check back next time to see a whole new string of progress. Motivated yet?

The Heart's period changes color at every 10%. so roughly every 2 and a half hours in a 24hour fast. Free free to peak the code!

This is the WATER gauge. It shows and tells you how much water you should be drinking. It's recommended to drink 2 liters of water per 24 hours during a serious fast. I recommend sticking to it for spiritual reasons.

When you press SEE REMAINING TO DRINK, it will show you immediately what you need to finish. 
When you press DRANK WATER, then you shold have drank an ounce of water for ever time you press it. In return, two "WATER"'s will
disappear before your eyes, while the counter updates itself.
