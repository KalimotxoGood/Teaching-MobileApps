# FastBreak -- A Fasting App


This is an Android app that implements the Android OS's use of background services to keep you on track while fasting. It keeps track of water needed to drink, time remaining for the fast, and a neat feature that changes the color of a heart emoji as you progress towards your goal. Feel free to check the app anytime to see how you're doing just as you would with social media apps!

Please enjoy this application! It is practical but can be also be a quirky way to get into fasting regimes for your health. Fasting has been shown to lower bloog sugar levels, diabetes, lower atrophy if done correctly and much more! Much much more. So far the app only works for 24 hour fasts due because of some casting issues making the user input unable to be inputted into the CountDownTimer machine by the Android OS library. Also perhaps due to some similar casting issues, the heart is unable to be changed. However, all the other feautures work wonderfully and I hope you put them to use! The water gauge feature is my favorite.
