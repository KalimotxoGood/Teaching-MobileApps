# Post Mortem
On this project I hurdled over some steep learning curves and got the chance to practice some valuable skills that improve productivity. In PA 2, I was a bit discouraged with my progress because I had overspent my limited amount of time trying to figure out how to save image files to the gallery. However, I learned from that experienced and I spent less time trying to solve implacable problems and  gaining the ability to let them go so that I can spend the time I had more productively. 
In PA3 I had to figure out many things on my own. Activity/layout switching, passing bundles through intents, and coming up with a way to save the Google API responses so that it may be shared through intents. Because I couldn’t pass a Google API response object in a bundle, I decided to make a class for  it so that any activity could access it as part of the same namespace. I thought that this would be a clever and more conventional way of doing attacking the problem because passing things through Activities seemed to complicated to me. I thought it was clever because I decided to make a forloop to save the top five google api responses into the class which held the responses and I made a list instance of the class with an ever increasing integer counter that kept track of when the items in the list needed to be changed. This turned out to be a very buggy solution and didn’t work because it wasn’t allowing the next google api results from the subsequent camera intents to be access. Instead, it stayed at the first result making the app work only once. Now that I think about it, saving the google api result and sending it again and again in each activity would have been a better solution at the cost of run time. I’m glad I was able to just “cut my losses.”
I was able to learn how to switch between Activities which I saw as a big accomplishment. Although I didn’t get to execute my understanding of that as cleanly as I would have liked in this assignment, I will make sure to do so in the next. I look forward to having some great layouts and pages for my next exploratory app. The funnest part of the assignment was everything because I was making good progress throughout and had a good work flow. Being able to drop things at the expense for being more productive in the present moment made the project much more fun because I was consistently building something up rather than staying static, stuck and stale from not getting anything done while doing the same worthless research for a solution. 
Suggestions for the future student would be that by this time you are so much more competent than you had been a month and a half ago. A month and a half while also taking 17 other units in college, I’d say is solid time to get this far in Xamarin and Visual Studio. Therefore, you should feel very comfortable at PA3 to experiment with workflow and the race against time.
